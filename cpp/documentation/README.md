# C++ Project Documentation

This document provides instructions and hints to document C++ projects.

## How to document code?

### C++ code

Public APIs should be documented with Doxygen.

### Python code

Python code may be documented with docstrings formatted using the
[Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings).

## Sphinx as unique documentation generator

The standard documentation tool for C++ projects is Doxygen whereas Sphinx is more widely used
in the Python community.

Breathe and Exhale are Sphinx extensions that allow a seemsless integration
of Doxygen in the Sphinx documentation pipeline.
Furthermore, most C++ projects within the HPC team provide Python bindings, which is another reason to use Sphinx as the standard tool to generate documentation of C++ projects.

## Sphinx documentation pipeline

`sphinx-build` is the main command line utility to generate documentation. This process
gathers a collection of documents in reStructedText to generate the documentation
in the desired format, in HTML for instance.

There are many Sphinx extensions to emit reStructuredText from other sources. Here is a
non-exhaustive list of recommended extensions:

### m2r

This extension provides a reStructuredText command named `mdinclude` to import a Mardown document.
For instance you can have a `readme.rst` file that reads the top-level README.md of your project that looks like:

```rst
Introduction
============

.. mdinclude:: ../README.md
```

### breathe

Doxygen is known to generated LaTeX or HTML, but it can also generate an XML document
containing the same level of information.
Breathe is a Sphinx extension to generate reStructuredText files from such XML file.

### exhale

Exhale is a Sphinx extension that does not really emit reStructuredText but allow
instead to configure and run Doxygen to generate the XML file used by Breathe.

### autodoc

Autodoc is a Sphinx extension that imports Python modules, and emits
reStructuredText from the docstrings of the symbols.

### napoleon

Napoleon is a Sphinx extension that allows autodoc to parse docstrings formatted
with the NumPy and Google coding styles.

### doctest

When enabled, Sphinx will execute the code snippets embedded in the documentation
and fail if they produce unexpected output.

For instance, let us consider the following `hello` Python module, part of a package to document:

```python
__version__ = '1.0.0'

def hello_world(recipient="World"):
    """Write greeting message to standard output

    Args:
       recipient(str): person included in the message

       >>> hello_world()
       Hello World!
       >>> hello_world("Alice")
       Hello Alice!
    """
    print("Hello", recipient)
```

* If _autodoc_ extension is enabled and properly configured, then Sphinx will load
  this module, and extract the docstring from the `hello_world` function.
* If _napoleon_ extension is enabled, then Sphinx will be able to properly extract
  the description and the information of the function parameter, formatted using
  the Google style, to produce a nice HTML document with the code snippet embedded.
* If this _doctest_ extension is enabled, the document generation with run the
  code snippet, and will fail because the output is not the one expected.
  You realize that you are missing a trailing "!" in the written message.

This is a very interesting feature that ensure that the documentation remains
up to date, and continuously tested.

### coverage

This extension provides the symbols of the Python package that have not been
called by the code snippets. The report is written a text file named
`doctest/output.txt`.

## Getting Started

### Generate skeleton

At the project root directory:

```bash
$ mkdir doc
$ cd doc
$ sphinx-quickstart --sep --makefile --no-batchfile --dot _ \
  --suffix .rst --language en --master index \
  --ext-autodoc --ext-doctest --ext-coverage --ext-mathjax --ext-viewcode
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.8.5 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Selected root path: .

The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: MyProject
> Author name(s): BlueBrain HPC Team
> Project release []: 

Creating file ./source/conf.py.
Creating file ./source/index.rst.
Creating file ./Makefile.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file ./source/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

$ git add *
$ git commit -m 'Create Sphinx documentation skeleton with sphinx-quickstart'
```

### Add Python package to the PYTHONPATH used by sphinx

For package `hello`:

```diff
diff --git a/docs/conf.py b/docs/conf.py
index 41dc1a7..4b51de3 100644
--- a/docs/conf.py

```

### Generate skeleton or reStructuredText files for Python package

The `sphinx-apidoc` utility analyzes Python packages and generates one reStructuredText
file per Python module, containing _automodule_ directives.

For instance, `sphinx-apidoc -o docs hello` command generates file `docs/hello.rst` that
looks like:

```rst
Module contents
================

.. automodule:: hello
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
```

This is enough to generate documentation of the `hello` module.
To generate documentation of symbols imported by `hello` module, consider using
the `:imported-members:` option of the `automodule` command.

## Toward a decent `setup.py`

Sphinx provides a `build_sphinx` setuptools target to generate documentation
with the command: `python setup.py build_sphinx`.

### Setup dependencies

Add all Python packages required to build the documentation to the `setup_requires`
[*setup* keyword](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#new-and-changed-setup-keywords)

If `doctest` is activated, then the generation of the documentation executes the Python package. Thus it is
recommended to also add the content of `install_requires` *setup* keyword to the `setup_requires` keyword.

For instance:

```python
install_requirements = [
    "cached-property>=1.5.1",
    "docopt>=0.6.2",
    "h5py>=2.7.1",
    "humanize>=0.5.1",
    "numpy>=1.13",
    "progress>=1.4",
]
doc_requirements = [
    "exhale",
    "m2r",
    "sphinx-rtd-theme",
    "sphinx<2"
]
setup(
    # [...]
    install_requires=install_requirements,
    setup_requires=install_requirements + doc_requirements
)
```

### test command on steroÃ¯d

By default, the command `python setup.py test` builds the package and
run the unit-tests. To also execute the code snippets embedded in the documentation during the `test` command, you can:

1. Define a new `doctest` command that only check the code snippets. In `setup.py`:

    ```python
    class lazy_dict(dict):
        """When the value associated to a key is a function, then returns
        the function call instead of the function.
        """
        def __getitem__(self, item):
            value = dict.__getitem__(self, item)
            if inspect.isfunction(value):
                return value()
            return value


    def get_sphinx_command():
        """Lazy load of Sphinx distutils command class
        """
        from sphinx.setup_command import BuildDoc

        return BuildDoc


    setup(
        # [...]
        cmdclass=lazy_dict(
            doctest=get_sphinx_command
        )
    ```

    In `setup.cfg`:

    ```
    [doctest]
    builder = doctest
    config-dir = docs
    ```


1. Overwrite the `test` command so that it also calls the `doctest` command.

    In `setup.py`:

    ```python
    from setuptools.command.test import test


    class CustomTest(test):
        """Custom disutils command that acts like as a replacement
        for the "test" command.

        It first executes the standard "test" command, and then run
        the "doctest" to also validate code snippets in the sphinx
        documentation.
        """

        def run(self):
            super().run()
            subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, __file__, "doctest"])


    setup(
        # [...]
        cmdclass=lazy_dict(
            test=CustomTest,
            doctest=get_sphinx_command
        )
    ```
