# C++ Code Formatting Documentation Generation Utility

This directory provides both documentation chunks and scripts to build 
BBP HPC team guidelines regarding C++ code formatting.

## Requirements

* A Python environment with *pyyaml* and *jinja* packages installed.
A `Pipfile` is provided at repository root path a courtesy to setup
such environment with *pipenv*.
* ClangFormat 7
* Pandoc

## How to build the documentation

Simple type `make`

## How to edit the documentation?

Edit `formatting.md.jinja` template or C++ code snippets in `snippets/` directory.
A C++ snippet has the following structure:

```cpp
// TITLE

// optional description
// that can be in *markdown*.
// Multiline description is supported

your cpp(code);
```
A C++ snippet should be named after the clang-format configuration key it highlights.
